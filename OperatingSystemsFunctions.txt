User interfaces are one function of an operating system.
The user interface provides a means for actually using the system.
There are variations on the user interface can be altered and tailored by the user.
Some operating systems allow touching/tapping instead of clicking.

Another operating system function is managing programs.
Managing multitasking programs is the function that most systems now run, opposed to single tasking a program.
One reason multitasking is used more, is to be able to have more than one program in the memory simultaneously.
This means more than one program can run at the same time.

Configuring devices is yet another important function for an operating system.
Devices need a driver to be able to function with the computer.
There are a lot of devices that run off of plug and play and will automatically download the driver to allow immediate usage.
